## Garden of Forking Paths {.smaller}

All data analysis projects must choose between different ways to analyze data. This is known as the garden of forking paths:

## Garden of Forking Data {.smaller}

In practice, this means we must choose between many possible versions of our dataset. Every data processing step leads to a different final dataset.

Enter the _**multiverse**_:

## Why Care About the Multiverse?{.smaller}

Ignoring the multiverse can lead to undesirable actions/outcomes:

## Multiverse Analysis

:::: {.columns}

- _**Transparently and systematically**_ analyze the whole multiverse
- Transparency reduces cherry-picking
- Systematically handling decisions reduces pigeonholing
