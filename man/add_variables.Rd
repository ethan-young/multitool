\title{Add a set of variable alternatives to a multiverse pipeline}
\usage{
add_variables(.df, var_group, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.df}{The original data.frame (e.g., base data set). If part of set of
add_* decision functions in a pipeline, the base data will be passed along
as an attribute.}

\item{var_group}{a character string. Indicates the name of the current set.
For example, "primary_iv" could indicate this set are alternatives of the
main predictor in an analysis.}

\item{...}{the bare unquoted names of the variables to include as alternative
options for this variable set. You can also use tidyselect to select
variables.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with three columns: type, group, and code. Type
indicates the decision type, group is a decision, and the code is the
actual code that will be executed. If part of a pipe, the current set of
decisions will be appended as new rows.
