## Installation

Install from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("multitool")
```


You can install the development version of `multitool` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ethan-young/multitool")
```

## Motivation

The goal of `multitool` is to provide a set of tools for designing and running multiverse-style analyses. I designed it to help users create an incremental workflow for slowly building up, keeping track of, and unpacking multiverse analyses and results.

## Multiverse Primer

For those unfamiliar with multiverse analysis, here is a short primer:

## Beyond Multiverse

I designed `multitool` to do multiverse analysis but its really just a tool for exploration. 

In any new field, area, or project, there is a lot of uncertainty about which data analysis decisions to make. Clear research questions and criteria help reduce uncertainty about how to answer them but they never fully reduce them. `multitool` helps organize and systematically explore different options. That's really it.

## Design

I designed `multitool` to help users take a single use case (e.g., a single analysis pipeline) and expand it into a workflow to include alternative versions of the same analysis. 

For example, imagine you would like to take some data, remove outliers, transform variables, run a linear model, do a post-hoc analysis, and plot the results. `multitool` can take theses tasks and transform them into a blueprint, which provides instructions for running your analysis pipeline.

The functions were designed to play nice with the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and require using the base R pipe `|>`. This makes it easy to quickly convert a single analysis into a multiverse analysis.

## Basic components

My vision of a `multitool` workflow contains five steps:

![](man/figures/workflow.png)

`multitool` cannot make decisions for you but -- once you know your set of data decisions -- it can help you create and organize them into the workflow above.

A defining feature of `multitool` is that it saves your code. This allows the user to grab the *code that produces a result* and inspect it for accuracy, errors, or simply for peace of mind. By quickly grabbing code, the user can iterate between creating their blueprint and checking that the code works as intended.

`multitool` allows the user to model data however they'd like. The user is responsible for loading the relevant modeling packages. Regardless of your model choice, `multitool` will capture your code and build a blueprint with alternative analysis pipelines.

Finally, multiverse analyses were originally intended to look at how model parameters shift as a function of arbitrary data decisions. However, any computation might change depending on how you slice and dice the data. For this reason, I also built functions for computing descriptive, correlation, and reliability analysis alongside a particular modelling pipeline. 

## Usage

```{r usage, message=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(multitool)

# create some data
the_data <-
  data.frame(
    id  = 1:100,
    iv1 = rnorm(100),
    iv2 = rnorm(100),
    iv3 = rnorm(100),
    mod = rnorm(100),
    dv1 = rnorm(100),
    dv2 = rnorm(100),
    include1 = rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = .1),
    include2 = sample(1:3, size = 100, replace = TRUE),
    include3 = rnorm(100)
  )

# create a pipeline blueprint
full_pipeline <- 
  the_data |>
  add_filters(include1 == 0, include2 != 3, include3 > -2.5) |> 
  add_variables(var_group = "ivs", iv1, iv2, iv3) |> 
  add_variables(var_group = "dvs", dv1, dv2) |> 
  add_model("linear model", lm({dvs} ~ {ivs} * mod))

full_pipeline

# Expand your blueprint into a grid
expanded_pipeline <- expand_decisions(full_pipeline)
expanded_pipeline

# Run the blueprint
multiverse_results <- run_multiverse(expanded_pipeline)
multiverse_results

# Unpack model coefficients
multiverse_results |> 
  reveal_model_parameters()

# Unpack model fit statistics
multiverse_results |> 
  reveal_model_performance()

# Summarize model coefficients
multiverse_results |> 
  reveal_model_parameters() |> 
  group_by(parameter) |> 
  condense(unstd_coef, list(mean = mean, median = median, sd = sd))

# Summarize fit statistics
multiverse_results |> 
  reveal_model_performance() |> 
  condense(r2, list(mean = mean, sd = sd))
```
