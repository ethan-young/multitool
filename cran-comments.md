## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed "Tools for" in the title

* Changed "... pipelines and turning then into a grid of all possible pipelines..." to "... pipelines and turning them into a grid of all possible pipelines..."

* I did not add references because there are not specific references for the methods used in the package

* Changed logical argument defaults from F to FALSE

* Added a \value section to show_code_filter.Rd

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
